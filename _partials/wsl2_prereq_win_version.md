### Minimum version

Some of the tools we need to install have been release with the `1903` version **or above** of Windows 10 so we need to make sure you have at least this one.


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `winver`
>\- Press `Enter`


Check the **Version number**:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If it is below `1903`, just follow the [Latest version of Windows](#Latest-version-of-Windows) paragraph above to install the latest updates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If it says at least `1903`, you are good to go! :sunglasses:
