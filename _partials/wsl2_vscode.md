## Visual Studio Code

We use Visual Code Studio for writing code on Windows, because it integrates nicely with the Ubuntu terminal.

For this integration to work, you need to uninstall other code editor, like for example SublimeText, as their WSL integration interferes with the integration of VS Code.

### Installation
>\- Go the [Visual Studio Code page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
>\- Choose the Windows version of VS Code


The tool should start to download automatically.

>\- Open the file you have just downloaded.  
>\- Install it with a few options:  
>    \- Register VS Code as an editor for supported file types  
>    \- Let the other options as they are

### Connecting VS Code to Ubuntu

- Launch VS Code a first time, then:
    - Pin it to the taskbar; you will be using it a lot!
    - You should have a frame at the bottom-right corner of VS Code saying it detects WSL
    - Accept the installation of the WSL extension for VS Code

:warning: This extension is mandatory for you to be able to work with VS Code!

### VS Code Shortcuts

In VS Code:


>\- Click on `File`  
>\- Click on `Preferences`  
>\- Click on `Keymaps`  
>\- Click on `Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer`  
>\- Click on `Install`


### VS Code Extensions

Let's gain time now and add other extensions that will be helpful during your Bootcamp.


For each of these extensions:


>\- On the web page, click on `install`  
>\- In the browser, accept to use VS Code to install the extension

### VS Code Settings
>\- Press `Ctrl` + `,` on your keyboard to open the settings  
>\- In the search bar, type `emmet`  
>\- Click on the first **`Edit in settings.json`** link


Paste the following just before the last `}`:

```bash
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "erb": "html"
},
```

It should look like this:

:warning: You should add a comma if there is none after the **`]`** like line 26 in the image above ☝️


:warning: Don't forget to save those changes!

### Final Check

To make sure everything works fine, close VS Code, then open your Ubuntu terminal:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`  
>\- Type  `ubuntu`  
>\- Press `Enter`


In Ubuntu, let's try to launch VS Code:

```bash
code
```
