## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
# it will ask for your session password
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim nodejs imagemagick jq
```
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

At then end, your terminal should look like this:

![zsh](images/wsl2_zsh.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If everything is correct, let's configure GitHub!

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes

  <summary>Error: "chsh command unsuccessful. Change your default shell manually."</summary>

  You probably typed the wrong password when asked.
  Starting the script again will not work as it will try to create a configuration folder that now already exists!

  We need to remove it first:

  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh
  ```


  Then let's try again!
