## ## A note about quitting apps on a Mac

Clicking the little red cross in the top left corner of the application window on a Mac **does not really quit it**, it just closes an active window. To quit the application _for real_ either press `Cmd + Q` when the application is active, or navigate to `APP_NAME` -> `Quit` in the menu bar.

During this setup you will be asked to **quit and re-open** applications multiple times, please make sure you do it properly :pray:

## Command Line Tools

Open the Terminal (click the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen and type `Terminal`):

Copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit Enter.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you receive the following message, you can just skip this step and go to next step.

```
# command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates
```

Otherwise, it will open a window asking you if you want to install some software. Accept and wait. If it fails, try again the command line above, sometimes the Apple servers are overloaded.

While it's downloading, you can go on with configuring your GitHub account, but **stop** before Homebrew. You'll need the command line tools installed for that step.

If you receive the following message, you need to update the sofware update catalog.

```
Xcode is not currently available from the Software Update server
```

In this case, copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit Enter.

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --clear-catalog
```

Once this is done, you can try to install again (copy-paste the following command and hit enter).

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Then follow the previous instructions for this command.
